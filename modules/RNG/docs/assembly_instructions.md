|    | Back  | R17       | Resistor         | 1kÎ©                                     | [Tayda](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/resistors/1-4w-metal-film-resistors/10-x-resistor-1k-ohm-1-4w-1-metal-film-pkg-of-10.html) | Determines output impedance. Any value is fine. |

Unlike the bottom LEDs, which are in series with R4-R7 (at 5v), this resistor is just used as a current reference (at 5v) by the TLC5940. To match the current across all the LEDs (and therefore the brightness), R18 is calculated by R18 = 5 / ((5 - V_LED) / R4), where V_LED is the voltage drop across one of the LEDs (at the current they will receive). This can be measured or will probably be in the LED datasheet. Then, round to the nearest available resistor value; it doesn't have to be exact. |

Judging by the datasheets, the TLC5941NT (also obsolete) should be a drop-in replacement if that is easier to find, but I haven't tested it yet. The [surface-mount version of this part](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Texas-Instruments/TLC5940PWPR?qs=p6lVfQR1GSp%2FLwrJ9hXGwQ%3D%3D) is still in production, so I might switch this component over to surface mount if they get too hard to find, or you can yourself. Unfortunately a generic HTSSOP-to-DIP adapter board won't work because the pinout is not the same. |
