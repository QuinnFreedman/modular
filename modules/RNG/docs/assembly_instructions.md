|    | Back  | R17       | Resistor         | 1kΩ                                     | [Tayda](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/resistors/1-4w-metal-film-resistors/10-x-resistor-1k-ohm-1-4w-1-metal-film-pkg-of-10.html) | Determines output impedance. Any value is fine. |
|    | Back  | R18       | Resistor         | 15kΩ                                    | [Tayda](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/resistors/1-4w-metal-film-resistors/10-x-resistor-15k-ohm-1-4w-1-metal-film-pkg-of-10.html) | **R18 was incorrectly labelled as a 2nd R2 in one print run.** Controls the LED brightness for the 7-LED display. Unlike the bottom LEDs, which are in series with R4-R7 (at 5v), this resistor is just used as a current reference (at 5v) by the TLC5940. To match the current across all the LEDs (and therefore the brightness), R18 is calculated by R18 = 5 / ((5 - V_LED) / R4), where V_LED is the voltage drop across one of the LEDs (at the current they will receive). This can be measured or will probably be in the LED datasheet. Then, round to the nearest available resistor value; it doesn't have to be exact. |

The [surface-mount (HTSSOP) version of this part](https://mou.sr/3MNLObk) is still in production. It is a little harder to solder than the through-hole parts but not impossible to do by hand. See [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp07EHngH4U). There are footprints on the PCB for both the through-hole **and** surface-mount parts. Either will work. **Use one or the other, not both**. The TLC5941NT (also obsolete, also through-hole) *should* be a drop-in replacement if that is easier to find, but I haven't tested it yet. | | 🔴 | Back  | U2        | DAC              | MCP4922-E/P                             | [DigiKey](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/MCP4922-E-P/716251), [Mouser](https://mou.sr/4cwtePf) | | |    | Back  | U3        | Op-amp           | MCP6004                                 | [Tayda](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/mcp6004-single-supply-cmos-ic.html), [DigiKey](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/mcp6004-i-p/523060) | |
