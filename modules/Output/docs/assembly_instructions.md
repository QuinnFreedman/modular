# Output Assembly Instructions

See [general assembly instructions](https://quinnfreedman.github.io/modular/docs/assembly)

Note: this design has 3 PCBs that are stacked into a sandwich. The small one (top) and the one with the large jacks (middle) both face UP, with their components facing the faceplate (as indicated by the silkscreen). The last PCB (bottom) faces down, with most of the components mounted on the side facing away from the faceplate. All three are connected together with a single pair of headers at the top and a set of screws or offsets at the bottom.

|    | Middle| R33                     | Resistor         | 33kÎ©                                    |         | R33-R38 provide the voltage reference for the volume meter. To get an accurate meter, they all must be the exact values given at 1% tolerance. But, if you don't have all the correct values, only the display will be effected; not the audio. Alternatively, if you want to use a different scale for the meters, you could use your own choice of values here. They are arranged as a voltage divider ladder from 12v to 0v. |

Different color LEDs might have slightly different brightnesses, so you might want to experiment tuning these values to make all your LEDs uniform. |

When not illuminated, these LEDs are exposed to 12v reverse current. Technically, this is outside the spec of most LEDs and could result in damage to the LED over time. If you are worried about this, you could look for LEDs with high reverse-voltage tolerance, or add a Zener diode or other high reverse voltage diode in series with one of the legs of each LED. But, after testing this design for a while with the cheapest Amazon LEDs, it seems like they were totally unaffected, so I wouldn't worry about it. |

ACJS-MV-3 is exactly the same except that it has a spiked washer, so that will work too (as will ACJS-MV-3S or ACJS-MV-5). Frustratingly, the [PJ-629HAN sold on Tayda](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/hardware/6-35mm-1-4-plugs-jacks/6-35mm-1-4-stereo-phone-jack.html) is *almost* an exact clone, but switches the left and right channels. You can edit the PCB to swap the channels back or just shell out for the original part. Or just live with your headphones reversed. |

There are a few ways to do this. You could use a stacking male/female header on the middle and use standard male/female headers on the top and bottom, use double-sided male headers on the middle and standard female on the top and bottom, or just use extra-long male headers and solder everything in place. The only thing that matters is that the offset between the front and middle PCBs is the right distance to align the large and small jacks. |

The NE5532AP is an extra low-noise version, although it's probably not worth the cost. The SA5532 is identical except it has a higher temperature range, which isn't necessary. If you have a particular op-amp you prefer, you can use it here instead (as long as it follows the standard TL072-style pinout). A TL072 should work fine too, although it might not have the best distortion characteristics or lifespan depending on what load you are hooking it up to. U5 and U6 are connected in parallel for extra driving power and distortion resistance on the headphone output. You can just leave them out if you don't need the extra power. |
