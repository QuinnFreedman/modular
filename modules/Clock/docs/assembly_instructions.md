| -- | ----- | --------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------- | ------- |
|    | Front | R1-R8     | Resistor         | 1kÎ©                                     | [Tayda](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/10-x-resistor-1k-ohm-1-4w-1-metal-film-pkg-of-10.html) | Determines output impedance. Any value is fine. |
|    | Front | R1-R8     | Resistor         | 5kÎ©-10kÎ©                                | [Tayda](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/10-x-resistor-10k-ohm-1-4w-1-metal-film-pkg-of-10.html) | Determines LED brightness. You may want to use a different value if you have different LEDs. A lower value means less resistance and brighter LEDs |
|    | Front | D1-D8     | LED              | 3mm                                     | [Tayda](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/36705-dup-led-3mm-blue-diffuse-lens.html) | Any standard 3mm LED will work here. |

| ðŸ”´ | Front | SW2       | Push button      | D6R30 F1 LFS                            | [DigiKey](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/c-k/D6R30-F1-LFS/1466331) | Make sure to line up the flat side of the button with the silkscreen on the PCB. This button could be replaced by a simple "6mm tactile switch" like [this](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/tact-switch-6-6mm-13mm-through-hole-spst-no.html) with a [cap](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/electromechanical/switches-key-pad/tact-switch/34189-dup-tactile-switch-caps-yellow-color.html) on it, but you may need to adjust the faceplate hole size. |
| ðŸ”´ | Front | Screen    | OLED display     | SSD1306 SPI                             | [ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/373647815247) | The underlying display controller is the SSD1306. There are many ebay/amazon sellers that make modules based on it. Make sure to get one that uses the SPI protocol (6 or 7 total pins) instead of the I2C protocol (4 pins). The pins may be labelled differently or be in a different order on different modules. Just connect them to the corresponding holes on the PCB. The module also may or may not contain a 7th RESET pin. Either way should be fine. Different modules may also vary in the layout of their mounting holes. The faceplate is designed for a 23.5mmx24mm bolt pattern, which seems to be common, but it could be easily modified to fit a different screen. You can connect the screen to the PCB by soldering each wire individually or by soldering on some kind of 7-pin plug. |

The two longer bolts can pass through to the PCB using additional nuts to hold everything together more firmly. |
