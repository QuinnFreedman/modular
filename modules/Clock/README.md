# Clock

A basic, 8-channel clock source with adjustable tempo, phase shift, pulse width, and swing.

If you want to do virtually anything with rythm in your modular rack, you will need a clock source to keep all your modules in sync. This module sends out triggers on each of its 8 channels that are all different subdivisions of the same tempo. Use them to trigger samples, ping envelopes, step sequencers, or whatever else you want to happen on beat.
