Determine if a given clock channel should be in its HIGH or LOW state based on its

Although the time units are all written as ms in this function, they can be scaled
up or down to any resolution by just multiplying the input time in current cycle and
time per cycle by a constant factor (i.e. to work in us precision)

In this function "core cycle" refers to the amount of time for the master clock to
loop, while "channel period" refers to the amount of time for the individual channel
to loop.
