You can try different values for a smoother signal or leave this out entirely if you don't mind some high-frequency artifacts. |

Leave unconnected for the default Perlin noise. You can solder a wire to bridge pairs 1 and/or 2 to select a different mode, or use pair of switches if you want to be able to change it later. See the manual for how to select algorithms. |
