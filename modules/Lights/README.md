<h1>Lights</h1>

<p>Lights allows you to control almost any kind of LED strip or smart LED matrix from your Eurorack case (WS2811, WS2812B, or PWM). Lights has 2 LED outputs: one for addressable LED strips that can plat various animations and visualizations, and one for solid-color RGB strips, like room lighting.</p>

<p>Lights lets you power those strips from an external power supply, so you don't overload your Eurorack power supply, while keeping the signals <b>totally electrically isolated</b> so there is no risk of groud loops, or adding digital noise to your power bus.</p>
