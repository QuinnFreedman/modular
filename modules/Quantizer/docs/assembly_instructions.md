|    | Board | Reference                  | Part             | Value                                   | Source  | Comment |
| -- | ----- | -------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------- | ------- |
|    | Front | R1                         | Resistor         | 10kÎ©                                    | [Tayda](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/resistors/1-4w-metal-film-resistors/10-x-resistor-10k-ohm-1-4w-1-metal-film-pkg-of-10.html) | |
|    | Front | R2-R13                     | Resistor         | 1kÎ©                                     | [Tayda](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/10-x-resistor-1k-ohm-1-4w-1-metal-film-pkg-of-10.html) |  |
|    | Back  | R18-R19, R31, R32          | Resistor         | 1kÎ©                                     |         | |
|    | Back  | R14-R17, R20-R23, R30, R33 | Resistor         | 10kÎ©                                    |         | R20-R21 and R22-R23 are matched pairs. Ideally, they would be hand-picked to match each other or they would be lower-tolerance resistors. But, RV1 and RV2 optionally let you compensate for any mismatches. |
|    | Back  | R24-R29, R34               | Resistor         | 100kÎ©                                   | [Tayda](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/resistors/1-4w-metal-film-resistors/10-x-resistor-100k-ohm-1-4w-1-metal-film-pkg-of-10.html) | R24-R25 and R26-R27 are also matched pairs, but they are less important since they only effect the input before quantization. |
|    | Back  | RV1, RV2                   | Potentiometer    | B1kÎ© trim                               | [Tayda](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/potentiometer-variable-resistors/cermet-potentiometers/1k-ohm-trimmer-potentiometer-cermet-25-turns-3296w-jb.html) | **Optional.** These trim pots let you tune the output to compensate for any imperfections in the hardware. If you match R20-R21 and R22-R23 to each other, tuning shouldn't be necessary. If you don't want to bother with these, you can just short all three legs together for each potentiometer. Otherwise, you will have to adjust them by hand. |
|    | Back  | C1-C3                      | Capacitor        | 10uF                                    | [Tayda](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/10uf-16v-85c-radial-electrolytic-capacitor.html) | **Optional.** Power supply noise filtering capacitor |
|    | Back  | C4-C8, C11                 | Capacitor        | 100nF                                   | [Tayda](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/capacitors/ceramic-disc-capacitors/a-553-0-1uf-50v-ceramic-disc-capacitor-pkg-of-10.html) | **Optional.** Power filtering and decoupling |
|    | Back  | C9, C10                    | Capacitor        | 100pF                                   | [Tayda](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/10-x-100pf-50v-ceramic-disc-capacitor-pkg-of-10.html) | **Optional.** Amp stabilizing caps |
|    | Front | J1-J8                      | 3.5mm Jack       | THONKICONN (a.k.a PJ398SM or PJ301M-12) | [Tayda](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/pj-3001f-3-5-mm-mono-phone-jack.html) | |
|    | Both  | J9-J14, J16-J17            | Pin headers      | 1x12, 1x12, 1x9, 1x10                   | Tayda ([Male](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/40-pin-2-54-mm-single-row-pin-header-strip.html), [Female](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/40-pin-2-54-mm-single-row-female-pin-header.html)), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074HVBTZ4) | Solder the two boards directly together using the male headers or make them detachable using a male/female pair. |
|    | Back  | J15                        | IDC connector    | 2x8                                     | [Tayda](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/16-pin-box-header-connector-2-54mm.html) | Eurorack power header |
| ðŸ”´ | Front | D1-D16                     | LED              | 3mm red-green bi-color common anode     | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/EDGELEC-Bi-Color-Diffused-Resistors-Included/dp/B077XG5NSC) | Make sure to get 3-pin bi-color LEDs with a shared (common) cathode in a KAK-configuration (cathode in the middle). When assembling, orient the LEDs so that the **red** cathode is in the **square hole** (where the anode would normally go in a regular LED). |
|    | Back  | A1                         | Arduino Nano     | v3.0                                    | [Tayda](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/type-c-nano-3-0-controller-compatible-with-arduino-nano.html) | |
| ðŸ”´ | Back  | U1                         | DAC              | MCP4922-E/P                             | [DigiKey](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/MCP4922-E-P/716251), [Mouser](https://mou.sr/4cwtePf) | |

|    | Back  | U3                         | Op-amp           | MCP6004                                 | [Tayda](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/mcp6004-single-supply-cmos-ic.html) | |
| ðŸ”´ | Front | SW1-SW15                   | Button           | TL1105SP (e.g. TL1105SPF250Q) + 1RBLK   | [DigiKey (switch)](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/e-switch/TL1105SPF250Q/271559), [DigiKey (cap)](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/e-switch/1RBLK/271579) | The caps for these switches need to be purchased separately. The caps I use are `#1RBLK`. The switches are available in different actuation forces and materials, so the last part of the part number might be a little different. Sometimes, the switches and caps will be sold together and the cap number is appended to the end of the part number. If you don't want to use these specific switches, any "6mm tactile switch" with a standard 4.5mm x 6.5mm mounting pattern like [this one](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/tact-switch-6-6mm-13mm-through-hole-spst-no.html) should work here. Those are a bit narrower, though, so you might want to adjust the faceplate accordingly. |
| ðŸ”´ | Both  | -                          | Mounting screw   | 2 M3x10mm standoff, 1 M3x11mm standoff or bolt |  | Two standoffs hold the front PCB to the faceplate, since the buttons don't attach to the faceplate. Optionally, you can also use one more standoff or bolt to hold the two PCBs together. |
