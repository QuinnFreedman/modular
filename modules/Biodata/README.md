<h1>Biodata</h1>

<p>Listen to plants! Generate pich CV, gates, and raw waveforms from any biological signal. Using tens cables (with clips or pads) Biodata listens to plants, fungi, people, or even other electronics. Based on the fluctuating electrical resistance between the probes as the subject moves or photosynthesizes, Biodata will generate 3 channels of quantized pitch CV and gates, as well as a raw waveform and smooth CV.</p>
