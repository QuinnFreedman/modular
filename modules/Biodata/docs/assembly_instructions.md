| ðŸ”´ | Back  | U3                         | Power isolator   | TEA 1-0505                              | [DigiKey](https://www.digikey.com/short/4jjrfr39), [Mouser](https://mou.sr/3PANyDz) | This electrically isolates the power sent over the probes from the rest of the Eurorack case. This is intended to reduce 60Hz hum or other electrical interference form being picked up as part of the signal. If you don't feel this is necessary, you can short pins 1 and 3 and pins 2 and 4 to bypass this component. |

Again, could be omitted and bypassed by shorting pins 1 and 4. Omit R15 as well in this case. |
