This project is an attempt to make Eurorack modular syntehsis affordable and accessable to everyone.

This repository contains open source software and hardware schematics for Eurorack modules which are designed to be assembled easily and cheaply without any technical knowledge. Every module should be able to be assembled for <$15 for CV modules and <$30 for audio modules in about an hour of work.

For more about this project and Eurorack in general, visit [the wiki](https://github.com/QuinnFreedman/modular/wiki).

For assembly instructions, see the `README` file in each module's folder, as well as the [general assembly instructions](https://github.com/QuinnFreedman/modular/wiki/Assembly).

**Happy travels on your modular journey!**
