Note: this project is currently undergoing a refactor. Most of the modules should still work, but they are in varying stages of redesign. Over the next few months, all the designs, documentation, and website should see a big improvement. Feel free to take a look at the desigs if you are interested, but you will probably have a better experience if you wait a few months to start building.

This project is an attempt to make Eurorack modular syntehsis affordable and accessable to everyone.

This repository contains open source software and hardware schematics for Eurorack modules which are designed to be assembled easily and cheaply without any technical knowledge. Every module should be able to be assembled for <$15 for CV modules and <$30 for audio modules in about an hour of work.

For more about this project and Eurorack in general, visit [the wiki](https://github.com/QuinnFreedman/modular/wiki).

For assembly instructions, see the `README` file in each module's folder, as well as the [general assembly instructions](https://github.com/QuinnFreedman/modular/wiki/Assembly).

**Happy travels on your modular journey!**
