1. position
2. size
3. density
  * -1 = no grains
  *  0 = (mean spacing = grain size) (if the output stdev == 0, this will recreate the original signal
  *  1 = double density (mean spacing = 1/2 grain size)
4. randomness
  * std dev of position in input (around *position*) or output or both
  * would change how freeze works
    * if randomness in where to sample from input, then freeze will have some random sounds
    * if randomness only in where to place sample, freeze will all be the same grain but with randomness in placing (i.e. 
    * if randomness in output position, positions could be calculated ahead (before audio sample comes in) so that a grain never needs to be placed in the past
    * if randomness in input sample position, then it could sample past the edges of the buffer
      * could just fold the distribution at buffer end
5. texture
  * shape of grain envelope
  * -1 = square
  *  1 = equal length attack/decay (max length)

6. pitch shift
  * V/O

7. feedback
  * -1 : no feedback
  * volume of output signal that is summed with the input and added to the front of the buffer

8. dry/wet blend

9. freeze
 * bool
 * if yes, stop recording (read cursor will stay at same point in buffer, adjustable by *position*)
