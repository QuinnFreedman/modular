  MCP23S17.h  Version 0.2
  Microchip MCP23S17 SPI I/O Expander Class for Arduino
  Created by Cort Buffington & Keith Neufeld

  February, 2016

  Features Implemented (by word and bit):
    I/O Direction
    Pull-up on/off
    Input inversion
    Output write
    Input read

  Interrupt features are not implemented in this version
  byte based (portA, portB) functions are not implemented in this version

  NOTE:  Addresses below are only valid when IOCON.BANK=0 (register addressing mode)
         This means one of the control register values can change register addresses!
         The default values is 0, so that's how we're using it.

         All registers except ICON (0xA and 0xB) are paired as A/B for each 8-bit GPIO port.
         Comments identify the port's name, and notes on how it is used.

         *THIS CLASS ENABLES THE ADDRESS PINS ON ALL CHIPS ON THE BUS WHEN THE FIRST CHIP OBJECT IS INSTANTIATED!

  USAGE: All Read/Write functions except wordWrite are implemented in two different ways.
         Individual pin values are set by referencing "pin #" and On/Off, Input/Output or High/Low where
         portA represents pins 0-7 and portB 8-15. So to set the most significant bit of portB, set pin # 15.
         To Read/Write the values for the entire chip at once, a word mode is supported buy passing a
         single argument to the function as 0x(portB)(portA). I/O mode Output is represented by 0.
         The wordWrite function was to be used internally, but was made public for advanced users to have
         direct and more efficient control by writing a value to a specific register pair.
		 
  VERSION RELESE NOTES:
	    V0.2
	   	Changed direct manipulation of pin 10 on ATMega168/328 via "PORTB" to use digitalWrite on an arbitrary
        SlaveSelect pin passed to the object through the constructor
