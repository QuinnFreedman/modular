1. Basic Oscillator
    * V/O CV
    * Wave shape select
    * octave select
2. Test keyboard
3. Passive attenuator
4. Passive mixer
5. ADSR Envelope (2HP?)
6. Bitcrusher
    * Switch between crushing horizontally (time) and vertically (amp)
    * Horizontal crush -> lowpass (Niquist theorem)
    * Dry/wet, crush amount controls
7. Lowpass filter 
    * Spring-damper physics based?
8. Fancy Oscillator
    * Shape/bend waveforms
    * 3 voices
9. Multivoice/detune osilator
    * Many digital voices that can be detuned from eachother
    * control voice number, detune amount, detune volume
    * Could this be done as a filter?
10. Granular synth
    * Controls:
        * Sample buffer position
        * Grain density (Negative = more random intervals b/t seeds)
            * + trig cv to seed a grain
        * Grain spread (i.e. how likely thte grain is to be sampled from far away)
        * Relative grain pitch
        * Grain length
11. Random function generator
    * Looping buffer of random values 
    * Adjustable chance for each value to be re-generated as it is played.
    * Gate to freeze loop.
    * Adjustable loop length 
12. Quantizer 
    * Scale presets (or select individual notes)
